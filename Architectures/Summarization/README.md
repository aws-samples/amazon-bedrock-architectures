# Summarization

Summarization is the process of generating a shorter version of a piece of text, while still conveying the main themes of that text. Summaries, similar to abstracts in academic papers, can help readers decide if they want to continue reading. They can also be used to quickly gather the gist of the text without needing to read the text in its entirety. 

To implement summarization, we will be making use of Large Language Models (LLMs), which take a text prompt as input, and produce text as output. We will format our prompt to instruct the model to write a concise summary of the provided text. As with any project involving language models, this process is not perfect. There is a chance that the model hallucinates and the summary is not accurate. However, there are several techniques to limit the chance of these errors. See the prompting sections in each folder for more information.
