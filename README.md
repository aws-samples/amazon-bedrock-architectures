This repository contains example solutions for various Generative AI use cases. The purpose of this repository is to provide a list of use cases to inspire your own use cases, a recommended architecture and deployment template to serve as a starting point for each use case, and example LLM prompts. 

The ```Architectures``` folder contains guidance and sample code for various Generative AI use cases. Each subfolder contains architectures and deployment templates for the use case. These templates are only meant to serve as sample code, you will most likely need to modify these templates for your own real-life use case.
